# About 

TestZilla is a distributed solution for stress test and benchmarks on Application Services, APIs, Web Servers and Network Protocols. TestZilla is currently under development, and its initial version is focused on Web Application Services and REST API. In TestZilla's development, we are trying to provide you with a home-based and cost-effective solution for setting up a benchmark lab. The goal is to create-N * 1000,000 RPS at your homemade lab. Currently, there are many open source solutions for stress testing and benchmarking in the open source community, thanks to all of them. We are trying to provide all the functional features of these tools in the form of a unique solution.
